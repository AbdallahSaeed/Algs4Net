    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Algs4Net is a .NET library port of <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/" target="_blank">algs4.jar</a> 
    with the goal to serve instructors and programmers who adopts the 
    <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Algorithms, 4th Edition</a> textbook and would 
    prefer to follow and demonstrate the text’s algorithms using C# in a .NET 
    environment. To meet the goal, Algs4Net was built using the following conventions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most classes in Algs4Net were ported from the corresponding classes in algs4.jar 
      with the class names, identifiers, and algorithm flows being kept intact whenever possible</li>
      <li>Each class in Algs4Net has a public static method <code>void MainTest(string[] args)</code> 
      as a substitute for the static main method in Java. As C# does not allow multiple 
      <code>Main(string[] args)</code> entries in a project, a command-line tool, algscmd, was 
      developed to call these MainTest methods.</li>
      <li>
        A part from keeping the class names and algorithm flows, certain method names in
        algs4.jar classes were slightly changed to follow a C# coding convention as follow:
        <ul>
          <li>First letters of public methods are in upper case (upper camel casing).</li>
          <li>C# properties are used in place of simple accessor methods. Most notably, 
          Java’s size() and isEmpty() methods become Count and IsEmpty properties respectively.</li>
          <li>C# indexers are used when the context permits. Particularly, the Algs4Net 
          symbol table classes such as BST are augmented with key-value indexers.</li>
          <li>Since not all C# types are reference types, boxing/unboxing are used to 
          convert value types to reference types. Whenever the conversion is not possible, 
          the C# compiler will detect the condition or a NullReferenceException is thrown 
          at runtime.</li>
          <li>When an exception needs to be thrown, the exception is selected following 
          the official .NET Framework libraries implementation. For example, accessing an 
          empty LinkedQueue object is a condition for InvalidOperationException, in the same 
          manner as the System.Collections.Generic.Queue object would do.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Finally, classes in Algs4Net were provided with well-formed XML comments to generate 
      HTML help documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To use the library, clone or download the 
    <a href="https://github.com/nguyenqthai/Algs4Net" target="_blank">Algs4Net</a> 
    solution and see <a href="../Doc/quickstart.html">Quick Start</a> for how to use the library.
    Refer the <a href="../Help/html/N_Algs4Net.htm">API Reference</a> for an online documentation
    of the library's classes.</p>
